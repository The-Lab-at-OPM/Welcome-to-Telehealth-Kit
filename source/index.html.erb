    <p>Welcome to Telehealth! Our goal is to provide Veterans with the right care, at the right place, and at the right time. Clinical Video Telehealth (CVT) aims to make the Veteran’s local community the preferred place of care whenever possible by bringing the best health care services to Veterans in distributed (and often remote) locations through the use of convenient and secure video conferencing technology.</p>
    <p>As a Veteran, you can now be connected to your VA health care provider in a virtual and real-time interaction. Telehealth provides great benefits and access to the best health care without having to make long trips to see your providers in person.</p>
    <p>This Telehealth Getting Started Kit is designed to help guide you through the initial steps of the onboarding process. A tablet is being shipped to you. Once it arrives, please complete the items on the checklist.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your participation in the Telehealth program. VA providers are committed to serving your health care needs in the most effective way possible. We want you to feel your best!</p>

  <section>
    <p>Telemedicine, also known as telehealth, uses electronic communications and information technology to provide and support healthcare when distance separates patients from the clinician (1). Telemedicine uses various communication methods to connect clinicians and patients in lieu of their meeting in person.</p>
    <p>The term "telemental health services" typically refers to behavioral health services that are provided using communication technology. These services include clinical assessment, individual and group psychotherapy, psycho-educational interventions, cognitive testing, and general psychiatry. The term telemental health describes the overall situation in which a clinician uses various technologies to deliver mental health care to a patient who is miles away.</p>
    <p>The major benefit of telemental health is that it eliminates travel that may be disruptive or costly. In addition, telemental health is a useful tool in situations, such as in correctional and forensic settings, where it is difficult to transport the patient to a clinician. Telemental health also allows mental health providers to consult with or provide supervision to one another.</p>
